    "Now that you know how to run SUMMA and have changed model options and parameters, we can start with the homework assignments. In this first homework, the focus will be on changing the meteorological variables that form the time-varying boundary conditions for the model simulations. They are also commonly referred to as model forcings. You will also modify some options that change how these model forcings are changed near the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "SUMMA forcing files are in NetCDF format and described in the [SUMMA documentation](https://summa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input_output/SUMMA_input/#meteorological-forcing-files). We will provide you with some functions and python code to modify the input files for the various exercises.\n",

    "You'll be using most of the techniques you learned in the `pysumma_howto.ipynb` notebook to modify SUMMA inputs. The new part here is that you will be modifying the NetCDF model forcing files. We don't need any special pySUMMA functions to accomplish this. Instead, we will use some of the functionality that is part of the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package, which is a very powerful package for analyzing and manipulating NetCDF files. `xarray` is already installed in this virtual machine, so there is no additional setup to get access to this package.\n",
